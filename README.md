# Revenue-Concentration-Customer-Risk
Revenue analysis of UK online retail using SQL and Excel

**Executive Summary**
This project assesses revenue, customer purchasing behaviour, and concentration risk using transactional data from a UK-based non-store online retailer. The analysis, conducted using SQL and Excel, shows that while net revenue is strong, performance is highly seasonal and heavily dependent on a small group of high frequency bulk buyers.

Approximately 60% of total revenue is generated by the top 10% of customers, indicating meaningful concentration risk. Revenue is also geographically concentrated, with the UK accounting for the majority of sales. While select European markets show modest traction, non-European regions contribute negligible revenue. Product descriptions suggest a culturally specific catalogue, which likely limits product–market fit outside Europe.

Overall, future performance depends on retaining high-volume customers, deepening engagement among mid-tier buyers, and selectively expanding within culturally adjacent European markets.

**Business Context**
Industry: Online retail selling giftware and home decor
Market: United Kingdom-based, non-store retailer

**Business Question**
How sustainable is the retailer buisness based on sales performance in 2011?

**Dataset**
* Source: Online Retail Dataset — UCI Machine Learning Repository
* Time Period: December 2010 – December 2011
* Records: approx. 541,000 transaction line items

Key Fields:
InvoiceNo, StockCode, InvoiceDate, Quantity, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country, Description

**Data Cleaning & Methodology**

To ensure consistency and comparability across KPIs:

* Cancelled invoices (InvoiceNo starting with “C”) were classified as returns rather than removed
* Transaction values were normalized, enforcing positive revenue for sales and negative revenue for cancellations due to inconsistent sign conventions in Quantity and UnitPrice
* Rows with missing CustomerID were excluded only for customer-level analysis
* Revenue trends and concentration metrics were calculated using normalized transactional revenue

**Key KPIs**
* Total Revenue (£): 9.8 M
* Month-over-Month Revenue Change (%): largest decline from November to December 2011, with revenue falling by approx. 79%
* Total Customers: 4339
* Average Order Value (£): 484.45
* Orders per Customer: 4.27
* Revenue Share: UK vs Rest of World (%): UK (84% share) 
* Top Non-UK Countries by Revenue Share: Netherlands, Ireland, Germamy. France
* Customer Revenue Concentration (Top 10%): account for 60% of revenue 

**Key Insights**
Revenue Performance & Volatility
* Revenue peaks sharply in Q4 with significant month-over-month volatility
* Performance is driven by strong seasonality rather than steady growth
* December revenue decline reflects promotion-led demand pull-forward (e.g. Black Friday, Christmas), not a structural demand drop

Customer Purchasing Behaviour
* High average order value despite low unit prices indicates bulk purchasing
* Customers place 4.27 orders on average, showing repeat purchasing
* Revenue growth is driven by purchase frequency and volume rather than premium pricing

Customer Concentration Risk
* Top 10% of customers generate ~60% of total revenue
* While the customer-level HHI remains low (0.0045), indicating a broad customer base, revenue dependence on top buyers exposes the business to churn risk

Geographic Concentration
* Revenue is heavily concentrated in the UK, making up 84% of overall revenue 
* Select European markets (Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France) show modest traction
* Non-European markets contribute negligible revenue
* Product descriptions suggest culturally specific offerings, implying limited product–market fit outside Europe

**Strategic Implications**

Customer Risk
* Revenue is sensitive to churn among high-volume buyers

Customer Growth Opportunity
* A large base of low and mid frequency customers exists but contributes disproportionately less revenue
* Increasing purchase frequency among mid-tier customers could reduce concentration risk

Geographic Focus
*  The UK remains the core market driving revenue 
* Near-term expansion is more viable in culturally adjacent European markets
* Broad international expansion would likely require changes to product assortment and suppliers

**Recommendations**
* Retain high-frequency bulk buyers through pricing and operational incentives (e.g. volume discounts, priority fulfilment)
* Develop mid-tier customers via repeat purchase incentives (subscriptions, loyalty programs, free shipping thresholds)
* Focus geographic growth within Europe where early traction exists

**Next Steps**
* Product-level profitability analysis to assess SKU-driven concentration
* Demand forecasting to distinguish predictable seasonality from structural demand changes
